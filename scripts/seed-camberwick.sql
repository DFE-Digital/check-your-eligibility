-- Camberwick FSM Expansion Test Organisations
-- =============================================================================
-- These organisations are reserved for FSM expansion testing only.
-- They must not be used by external or production users.
-- Suitable for DEV / TEST / PREPROD environments.
--
-- Summary:
--   LA  (FSM basic version)    : Camberwick Council            (LocalAuthorityID = 9000)
--   MAT (FSM enhanced version) : Camberwick Academy Trust      (MultiAcademyTrustID = 9001)
--   School (FSM enhanced)      : Camberwick Community School   (EstablishmentID = 600001, DSI URN 600001)
--   Academy (FSM enhanced)     : Camberwick Academy            (EstablishmentID = 600002, DSI URN 600002)
--
-- NOTE: EstablishmentIDs were updated from the original placeholders (9002/9003)
-- to match the real URNs registered in the DSI portal (600001/600002) - see
-- scripts/Backfill-CamberwickEstablishmentUrns.sql for the one-off migration
-- that repointed existing data in already-seeded environments.
